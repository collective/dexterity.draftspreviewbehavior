experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts Installation
-------------------------

#To install experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
#using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
#
#* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
#  ``easy_install experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts``. Find out how to install setuptools
#  (and EasyInstall) here:
#  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
#
#* Create a file called ``experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts-configure.zcml`` in the
#  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
#  should only contain this::
#
#    <include package="experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        experimental.dexterityz3cformdrafts
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
